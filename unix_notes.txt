    The following are various ways to display what's in a particular directory.
    See more by googling ls man since manuals aren't a thing on Windows.
    2  ls -s
    3  ls -S
    4  ls -v
    5  ls -x
    6  ls -X
    7  ls -l
    8  info ls
    9  ls -1
   10  ls -a
   11  ls --h
   12  ls --help
   23  ls -c
   24  ls -x
These let us view the history.  Less takes that history and displays it in a
user friendly way.
   48  history
   51  history | less
We were trying to access help here and didn't do it properly.  You can access help
in less by opening something in less first and then typing h.
   52  ls -h
   53  less h
   54  less H

   59  history | sort
This sorts the history and displays in less
   60  history | sort | less
This does not sort the history because it's in the wrong order.
   61  history | less | sort
This puts the history into a new text file
   62  history > moving_around.txt

I'M MAKING ALL KINDS OF CRAZY CHANGES!
